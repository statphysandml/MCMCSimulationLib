This is an explanation of the file structure that the cookiecutter
generated for you:

* C++ source files:
  * `include/examples/examples.hpp` is the main
    C++ header that declares the interface of your library.
  * `src/examples.cpp` is the main file that implements this library.
  * `app/examples_app.cpp` is an executable that uses the library.
    This can e.g. be used to provide a command line interface for your project.
* CMake build system files
  * `CMakeLists.txt` describes the CMake configuration script. You can find such files
    in many directories. When CMake runs, the `CMakeLists.txt` from the top-level directory
    executes top to bottom. Whenever a command `add_subdirectory(<dir>)` is executed,
    the `CMakeLists.txt` file from the directory `<dir>` is immediately executed. A comprehensive
    reference of CMake's capabilities can be found in the [official CMake docs](https://cmake.org/documentation/).
    A well-written, opinionated book for beginners and experts is [Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/).
* Markdown files with meta information on the project. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is
  a good language for these files, as it is easy to write and rendered into something beautiful by your git repository
  hosting provider.
  * `README.md` is the file that users will typically see first when discovering your project.
  * `COPYING.md` provides a list of copyright holders.
  * `TODO.md` contains a list of TODOs after running the cookiecutter. Following the
    instructions in that file will give you a fully functional repository with a lot
    of integration into useful web services activated and running.
  * `FILESTRUCTURE.md` describes the generated files. Feel free to remove this from the
    repository if you do not need it.
